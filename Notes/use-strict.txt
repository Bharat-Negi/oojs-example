use strict is a directive in JavaScript that enables strict mode, which helps write safer and more secure JavaScript code by catching common errors and preventing the use of potentially problematic features.

Why Use Strict Mode?
- Catches common coding errors
- Prevents accidental global variables
- Makes code more optimized and faster
- Prepares for future JavaScript versions
- Improves code quality and security
It's considered a best practice to always use 'use strict' in modern JavaScript development.
